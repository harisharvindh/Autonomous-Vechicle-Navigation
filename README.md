# Autonomous-Vechicle-Navigation
Utilizing UDACITY Simulator to train a model for autonomous driving

The Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator, demonstrated by the PowerMode_autopilot class, offers a sophisticated method for training machines in autonomous vehicle navigation. This framework combines computer vision and deep learning to interpret driving environments and make decisions in real-time.

Developed in Python and using key libraries like Keras, OpenCV, and pandas, the simulator trains autonomous driving models in a simulated environment that replicates real-world scenarios. It collects driving data, including images from three camera perspectives and steering angles, forming a dataset essential for model training.

The process involves organizing this data from a driving_log.csv file into training and validation sets to ensure the model learns effectively and can apply its knowledge to new situations. This is vital for creating a reliable autonomous driving system capable of handling different driving conditions.

The architecture of the neural network is a multi-layered convolutional neural network (CNN). Initial layers normalize the input images, while subsequent layers, with Exponential Linear Units (ELU) activations, extract and learn features from the images. The model also uses techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and focus on learning key features.

Data augmentation introduces variety to the training set, simulating different driving conditions and making the model adaptable to real-world scenarios. Image preprocessing, including cropping, resizing, and converting color spaces, reduces the computational load and centers learning on important image aspects.

Training is efficiently designed to maximize both efficiency and effectiveness. A batch generator manages memory use and allows for large dataset training on limited-resource hardware. The training utilizes real-time data augmentation and parallel processing to ensure optimal GPU usage.

The use of the Adam optimizer, a selective learning rate, and callbacks to save the best models based on validation loss reflects a deep understanding of deep learning training strategies. This approach leads to a robust model capable of navigating autonomous driving's complexities.
